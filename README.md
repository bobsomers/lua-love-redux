# Lua with LOVE: Redux

This is the complete source code and slides for a talk I gave for the
(http://www.cpgd.org)[Cal Poly Game Development Club] in November of 2011 in
preparation for the Global Game Jam.

The slides explain the basic syntax of the Lua language, some standard game
programming paradigms, and how the LOVE framework is structured.

In the workshop portion of the talk (after the slides), we built the simple game
contained in the source, RAGE. To run the game, clone the GitHub repository (or
download the files) and drag the rage directory onto your LOVE executable.
